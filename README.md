# Mathema
Mathema was created to read and solve simple equations as POC project. At current state it can solve linear and quadratic equations.

P.S. I have learned a lot about processing mathematical equations and decided to put this project on hold. There is a lot of CAS programs out there that are easy to use and offer a lot for free. I had a  lot of fun working on this project for a month. Maybe I'll get back to it some day. Cheers!

**Example**
(2+1)^2-Cos(0)*-2-1  
gives  
10
